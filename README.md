# CSE3910-Project

## Description 
We created a classic take on an aim trainer minigame found in most FPS video games, while our original plan was to simply have the mouse move around the screen, we decided to try to make the gameplay as similar to a classic FPS as possible, so we had the mouse stay centered and control a crosshair which would essentially control the entire window. Besides that, we added three seperate gamemodes for players to train their accuracy to.

### Gridshot
Consisting of 5 randomly placed and spawning targets within a relatively close area, this gamemode prompts players to train fine mouse movements as quickly as possible, ending once the player reaches 10 hits 

### Webshot
A single target capable of moving to great distances; this gamemode trains players flicks. With the target respawning everytime in a branching location, the player's mouse creates a "web" on the screen

### Flashshot
An unclickable target that is shown to the player for a brief period of time before the player's screen is "flashed" requiring the player to train their spacial awareness to hit the target through the flash.

## Running the Program 
To run the program, click run on the "main.py" file and use your mouse interact with the game.
